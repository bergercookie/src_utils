Use Modules for
- Global variable declaration
- Subroutine, function declarations
- New type definitions

For now on I put all my subroutines, functions, derived types inside modules!
Compiling a module creates a .o AND a .mod file
The module must be compiled before any program, subroutine Uses it!

There is a save statement after the variable declarations if you want to use them as Global variables
